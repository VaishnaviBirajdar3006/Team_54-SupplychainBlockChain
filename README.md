# Blockchain-based Medicine Tracking in the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain

## Project Overview

In the realm of the pharmaceutical industry, ensuring the authenticity and transparency of medicines along the supply chain is crucial for consumer safety. This project proposes a robust solution that utilizes blockchain technology to revolutionize the tracking process within the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain.


## Key Features

- **Blockchain Integration:** The core of our project is built on blockchain technology. By implementing a blockchain-based system, we aim to create a secure, transparent, and tamper-resistant platform for tracking medicines from their origin to the point of purchase.

- **Stakeholder Verification:** New stakeholders joining the supply chain are verified by the existing participants. Once verified, they are included in the blockchain network, ensuring that only trusted parties are involved.

- **Data Storage and Transfer:** As materials are transported from one stakeholder to another, the pertinent data is stored securely within a database. This data represents critical information about the materials, their origin, and their destination.

- **QR Code Integration:** To enhance traceability, each medicine unit is assigned a unique QR code. These codes are shared among the stakeholders of the supply chain, enabling users to easily track the medicines back to their source.

## Implementation Details

Our technology stack includes the following components:

- **W3.JS, JavaScript, jQuery:** These technologies are employed to create an interactive and user-friendly web interface that facilitates data entry and access.

- **Ethereum Solidity Smart Contracts:** Smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain ensure the execution of predefined rules and agreements between stakeholders. These contracts automate and validate the process.

- **HTML and CSS:** Our user interface is built using HTML and CSS to provide an intuitive experience for stakeholders interacting with the system.

- **PHP and MySQL:** PHP is utilized to connect with the backend, while MySQL handles the database management, storage, and retrieval of crucial data.
